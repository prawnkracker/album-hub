# Album Hub (React Phase 2 Project)

I created this web application to allow users to find new albums from other people in the community and share their own taste of music by adding albums they like as well.

## Home Page

The home page gives a basic overview of the functionality of the application. With a friendly and recognizable picture. 

## Album List

The album list component allows users to see all the albums currently existing on the web application. It also allows them to add any of the albums to their favorites by pressing the "Add to Favorites â™¡" button. Additionally, they can filter out albums by a certain genre or search for a specific album.

## Favorites

The favorites component allows users to view the albums they added to their favorites. If a user decides they no longer want that album in their favorites, they can click the "Remove From Favorites" button to remove it. The favorites component also has the same search and filter functionality as the album list component. 

## New Album Form 

This form allows users to add albums they would like to see on the album list. 

## Client Side Routes

This application uses 4 client side routes in the navigation bar to navigate to each component as the user sees fit.
